            Dey was born on December 13, 1990, in Kolkata, India. Dey is the only child of a painter mother, Soma Dey, and a commercial artist father, Sudip Dey. He attended South Point High School in Kolkata, India and went to study bachelor's in Computer Science at St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, where he graduated with a first-class degree (2012). After graduating with a Computer Science degree Dey pursued a career of an engineer, a scientist and an entrepreneur.

            In 2012, Dey invented a digital QR authentication system that was adopted by institutes around the world to stop the generation of fake degree certificates. In 2013, he moved to the U.K. to pursue a master's study and while pursuing his MSc at the University of Manchester in 2014, his parents had a car accident that made him the family's sole breadwinner. Sending money to his family to support them left Somdip with an empty bank account and he was left to collect food waste from dumpsters.
          </p>

          <p>
            This led him to co-found Codeepy, a start-up committed to co-developing the world's first crowd food-sharing platform, which was made open source. It won the 3Scale API Award at the Koding's 2014 Global Hackathon &amp; inspired entrepreneurs around the world to develop similar solutions.
