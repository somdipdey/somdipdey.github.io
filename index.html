          In 2013, he moved to the U.K. to pursue master's study and while pursuing his MSc at the University of Manchester in 2014, his parents had a car accident that made him the family's sole breadwinner. Sending money to his family to support them left Somdip with an empty bank account and he was left to collect food waste from dumpsters. This led him to co-found Codeepy, a start-up committed to co-developing the world's first crowd food-sharing platform. It won the 3Scale API Award at the Koding's 2014 Global Hackathon & inspired entrepreneurs around the world to develop similar solutions. <br /><br />

          In 2020, when the pandemic took over the world and people started to overbuy groceries to adapt to the changing shopping schedule, it ran the risk of increased food wastage at home. Dey co-developed an award-winning AI powered food management app - nosh - to help users reduce food waste in the household. In 2021, Dey co-founded Nosh Technologies (nosh tech inc.), which provides the nosh app solution to reduce food waste at home, and he also assumed the role of the CEO of the company. <br /><br />

          To stop addiction of centralised social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook among the general masses through advertisement business model, Dey co-developed a decentralised social media platform - Cloutted - built on top of social cryptocurrency such as Bitclout. Dey also co-founded Cloutted based on the flagship social media platform in 2021. <br /><br />

          Dey is a member of the technical program committee and reviewer of several top technical conferences on Artificial Intelligence and Electronic Design Automation fields such as AAAI, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICLR, ASAP, IEEE EdgeCom, IEEE CSCloud, etc. He is also an editor of numerous academic journals.<br /><br />

          In regard to visual arts and theatre, Dey made his first debut in the documentary, "Unity" (2020), talking about his experience of the COVID-19 pandemic.
